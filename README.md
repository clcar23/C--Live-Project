# C#-Live-Project
Snippets and explanations of code i worked on during a 2-week live project.

### Introduction
For two weeks I worked with other students in the Tech Academy putting together a project over Microsoft Azure's DevOps. Our project was a full scale
**MVC/MVVM Web Application** in **C#** utilizing **ASP .NET and Entity Framework**. It's an interactive website for managing the content and productions of a theater/acting 
company. It was a great opportunity to add requested features, fix bugs, and collaberate with the team in an **Agile** environment.

### Tools For the Project:
- Microsoft's Visual Studio
- C#
- Html/CSS
- JavaScript/Razor syntax
- Bootstrap 5/Font Awesome



## Back End Stories
- creating an entity model for my RentalPhoto class that saves to the database. Adding the schema for the **SQL** model and scaffolded the CRUD pages. 
**Microsoft's Visual Studio** made it much quicker and easier to get things set up.


## Front End Stories
- added styling to the different pages. **Html, CSS, Razor syntax, and JavaScript** all came into play on these stories. I did a lot of designing per request. **Bootstrap** helped do the heavy lifting and **Font Awesome** icons added style.


## Summary
Although this wasn't my first live project working with a team of developers, it was for others. I enjoyed being able to help, and be helped out with my fellow
devs. I was able to help another developer get his entire card display to be clickable and I learned about converting an image into a byte array and then being able to display it in the View.
