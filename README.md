# C#-Live-Project
Snippets and explanations of code i worked on during a 2-week live project.

### Introduction
For two weeks I worked with other students in the Tech Academy putting together a project over Microsoft Azure's DevOps. Our project was a full scale
**MVC Web Application** in **C#** utilizing **ASP .NET and Entity Framework**. It's an interactive website for managing the content and productions of a theater/acting company. I was assigned to the Rental section where I had to get the functionality and styling done. It was a great opportunity to add requested features, fix bugs, and collaberate with the team in an **Agile** environment.

### Tools For the Project:
- Microsoft's Visual Studio
- C#/SQL
- Html/CSS
- JavaScript/Razor syntax
- Bootstrap 5/Font Awesome



## Back End Stories
- Creating an entity model for my RentalPhoto class that saves to the database. Adding the schema for the **SQL** model and scaffolded the CRUD pages. 
**Microsoft's Visual Studio** made it much quicker and easier to get things set up.


Here is a clip from the Controller with some of the methods that get data from the model, or display a view.

This is converting the image to a byte array and saving it to the database.

## Front End Stories
- Added styling to the different pages. **Html, CSS, Razor syntax, and JavaScript** all came into play on these stories. I did a lot of designing per request. **Bootstrap** helped do the heavy lifting and **Font Awesome** icons added style.

Here is some code from my Create page so the user can assign input for the different fields in my database model.

And the Delete page.

This is the Index page where I discovered how to wrap my card in an anchor tag to make it clickable.

My Edit page so the user can go back and change imputs.

The Details page calls up the specific item in the database and displays all its elements.

The final Delete page view.

The Create page final product as per the request.

This is the Index page final product.

Here I wanted to show how the icons that appear when the image is hovered.

## Summary
Although this wasn't my first live project working with a team of developers, it was for others. I enjoyed being able to help, and be helped out with my fellow
devs. I was able to help another developer get his entire card display to be clickable and I learned about converting an image into a byte array and then being able to display it in the View. Overall I had a great time and look forward to doing it again!
